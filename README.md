# projectHGT

Recombination and horizontal gene transfer in the light of quasispecies theory, or something like that.
In this project, we can include the grind files, the python code, and potential individual-based models for easy collaboration.
Rejoice, we no longer have to copy files back and forth!

Bacio!

Important note: in order for this to work properly, you need a local git repository. In that way, you can work locally on your code,
and run it, and still have github keep track of our join progress.
