# projectHGT

Recombination and horizontal gene transfer in the light of quasispecies theory, or something like that.
In this project, we can include the grind files, the python code, and potential individual-based models for easy collaboration.
Rejoice, we no longer have to copy files back and forth!

Bacio!
